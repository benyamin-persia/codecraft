# ðŸš€ CodeCraft Quick Start

## Option 1: Use with npx (Recommended)

```bash
# From your project root directory
npx codecraft@latest
```

That's it! CodeCraft will:
- âœ… Auto-detect your project
- âœ… Connect to Cursor AI
- âœ… Start the server
- âœ… Show you how to install the browser extension

## Option 2: Local Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <your-repo>
cd codecraft
npm install

# Run from your project directory
node bin/codecraft.js
```

## What Happens Next

1. **CodeCraft starts** and shows you the setup
2. **Install browser extension** from the path shown
3. **Open your app** in the browser
4. **Click elements** and tell AI what to change
5. **Watch your code update** automatically!

## Requirements

- âœ… **Cursor AI** running (the AI you already use)
- âœ… **Frontend project** (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- âœ… **Browser** (Chrome/Edge for extension)

## No API Keys Needed!

CodeCraft uses your existing Cursor AI - no OpenAI API or other services required.

**That's it! Start coding visually with AI! ðŸŽ¯**
